        want to work around your needs. Some customers want yard maintenance done throughout the
        summer season and weekly check-ins in the offseason. Some want the house ready for
        holidays with on-call services when they are not there. Call, text, or fill out the questionnaire
        below for a free consultation on how we can provide peace of mind for your vacation home!`

      question: "How would a Home Watch Membership benefit me?",
      answer:
        `Having trust-worthy residents of the Lake of the Ozarks provide personalized check-ins in and
        outside your home gives you the sense of security that your property is in perfect condition all
        year-round. Becoming an SPS member gives you the opportunity to save money on pressure
        washing, boat cleaning, yard cleaning and any concierge services you want done throughout
        the year. This takes away the hassle of calling multiple different services to take care of your
        personal property.`

        `We can pressure wash your dock, driveway, golf cart path, boat sheds, patios, pool area, and
        dock roof. We also use a soft wash system for any sensitive material like vinyl siding and
        wooden decks. We make sure to use soaps that comply with the Clean Water Act so it is safe to
        clean surfaces near the lake!`

      question: "What are concierge services?",

        can make sure groceries are stored in the fridge and beverages are in coolers before you even
        get there. We can set out all patio and dock furniture before arrival so you do not have to lift a
        finger as well. When the group is ready to leave, we can come in and clean the place up as well.`
